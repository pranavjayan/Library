                **The Calculating Stars** by Mary Robinette Kowal is an alternate history science fiction novel that reimagines humanity’s race to space in the wake of a global disaster. The story begins in 1952 when a massive meteorite strikes Earth, devastating much of the Eastern United States and triggering catastrophic climate change. Scientists predict the planet will soon become uninhabitable, spurring humanity to turn its eyes to the stars as the only hope for survival.

At the center of the story is Dr. Elma York, a brilliant mathematician and former World War II pilot. As the fallout from the disaster escalates, Elma joins the International Aerospace Coalition (IAC), which is tasked with establishing a space program to ensure humanity’s survival. Despite her expertise and experience, Elma faces significant obstacles, including rampant sexism and racism within the scientific and aerospace communities.

Elma’s determination to become the first female astronaut and her advocacy for gender equality in the space program form the heart of the narrative. Balancing her personal struggles with anxiety, her supportive marriage to engineer Nathaniel York, and her groundbreaking contributions to the mission, Elma becomes a symbol of perseverance and progress.

Combining meticulous scientific detail with a deeply human story, **The Calculating Stars** is a powerful exploration of resilience, ambition, and the fight for equality in the face of global crisis. It’s both a compelling alternate history and an inspiring tale of humanity reaching for the stars.</h6>
