                Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone by J.K. Rowling is the magical tale of an ordinary boy who discovers an extraordinary destiny. Harry Potter, an orphan raised by his cruel Aunt Petunia, Uncle Vernon, and spoiled cousin Dudley, lives a bleak life in a cupboard under the stairs. On his eleventh birthday, he is astonished to learn that he is a wizard, famous in the magical world for surviving an attack from the dark wizard Voldemort that left his parents dead and him with a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead. Hagrid, a kind-hearted giant, whisks Harry away to the wizarding world, introducing him to the wonders of Diagon Alley, where he gets his first wand and learns of his place in this new world.
                At Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Harry quickly finds a home he’s never known before. He befriends the loyal and funny Ron Weasley and the clever and brave Hermione Granger, forming a trio that will face adventures together. Guided by the wise headmaster Albus Dumbledore, Harry begins to uncover his parents' legacy, his connection to Voldemort, and the mysteries of the magical school. Alongside learning charms, potions, and broomstick flying, Harry stumbles upon the secret of the Philosopher’s Stone, a legendary object that grants immortality.
                As the school year unfolds, Harry and his friends discover that the stone is hidden within the castle, protected by a series of magical challenges. They suspect that Professor Snape, their menacing Potions teacher, is trying to steal it for Voldemort. In a climactic confrontation, Harry learns that the real villain is Professor Quirrell, who is hosting Voldemort’s weakened spirit. Harry manages to protect the stone, thwarting Voldemort’s plan for resurrection. The story ends with Harry returning to the Dursleys for the summer, knowing that his magical journey is just beginning.
                This first installment sets the stage for a tale of courage, friendship, and the battle between good and evil.
